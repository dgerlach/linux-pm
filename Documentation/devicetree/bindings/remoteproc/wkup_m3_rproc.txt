Wakeup M3 Remote Proc Driver
=====================

TI AMx3 family of devices use a Cortex M3 co-processor to help with various
low power tasks that cannot be controlled from the MPU. The CM3 requires
a firmware binary to accomplish this. The wkup_m3 remoteproc driver handles
the loading of the firmware and booting of the CM3.

Wkup M3 Device Node:
====================
A wkup_m3 device node is used to represent a wakeup M3 IP instance within
a SoC.

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible:		Should be "ti,am3353-wkup-m3" for AM33xx SoCs
- reg:			Contains the wkup_m3 register address ranges for
			umem and dmem.
- ti,hwmods:		Name of the hwmod associated with the mailbox
- ti,no-reset-on-init:	Reset is handled after fw has been loaded, not at
			init of hwmod.

Example:
--------
/* AM33xx */
wkup_m3: wkup_m3@44d00000 {
	compatible = "ti,am3353-wkup-m3";
	reg = <0x44d00000 0x4000	/* M3 UMEM */
	       0x44d80000 0x2000>;	/* M3 DMEM */
	ti,hwmods = "wkup_m3";
	ti,no-reset-on-init;
};

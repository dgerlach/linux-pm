Bindings for TI's CPUFreq driver
================================

The ti-cpufreq driver works with the operating-points-v2 binding described
at [../opp/opp.txt] to make sure the proper OPPs for a platform get enabled
and then creates a "cpufreq-dt" platform device to leverage the cpufreq-dt
driver described in [cpufreq-dt.txt].

Certain TI SoCs, like those in the am335x, am437x, am57xx, and dra7xx
families support different OPPs depending on the silicon variant in use.
The ti-cpufreq driver uses the revision and an efuse value from the SoC to
provide the OPP framework with supported hardware information. This is used
to determine which OPPs from the operating-points-v2 table get enabled. In
order to maintain backwards compatilibity if this information is not present
the "cpufreq-dt" platform device is still created to attempt to find an
operating-points (v1) table, otherwise no OPPs will be available because
safe OPPs cannot be determined.

Required properties:
--------------------
In 'cpus' nodes:
- operating-points-v2: Phandle to the operating-points-v2 table to use
- ti,syscon-efuse: Syscon phandle, offset to efuse register, efuse register
		   mask, and efuse register shift to get the relevant bits
		   that describe OPP availability
- ti,syscon-rev: Syscon and offset used to look up revision value on SoC

In 'operating-points-v2' table:
- opp-supported-hw: Two bitfields indicating:
	1. Which revision of the SoC the OPP is supported by
	2. Which eFuse bits indicate this OPP is available

	A bitwise and is performed against these values and if any bit
	matches, the OPP gets enabled.

NOTE: Without the above, platform-device for "cpufreq-dt" is still created
      but no determination of which OPPs should be available is done, but this
      allows for use of a v1 operating-points table.

Example:
--------

/* From arch/arm/boot/dts/am4372.dtsi */
cpus {
	cpu: cpu@0 {
		...

		operating-points-v2 = <&cpu0_opp_table>;

		ti,syscon-efuse = <&scm_conf 0x610 0x3f 0>;
		ti,syscon-rev = <&scm_conf 0x600>;

		...
	};
};

cpu0_opp_table: opp_table0 {
	compatible = "operating-points-v2";
	opp50@300000000 {
		opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <300000000>;
		opp-microvolt = <950000>;
		opp-supported-hw = <0xFF 0x01>;
		opp-suspend;
	};

	opp100@600000000 {
		opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <600000000>;
		opp-microvolt = <1100000>;
		opp-supported-hw = <0xFF 0x04>;
	};

	opp120@720000000 {
		opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <720000000>;
		opp-microvolt = <1200000>;
		opp-supported-hw = <0xFF 0x08>;
	};

	oppturbo@800000000 {
		opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <800000000>;
		opp-microvolt = <1260000>;
		opp-supported-hw = <0xFF 0x10>;
	};

	oppnitro@1000000000 {
		opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <1000000000>;
		opp-microvolt = <1325000>;
		opp-supported-hw = <0xFF 0x20>;
	};

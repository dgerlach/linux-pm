EMIF SRAM Driver
=====================

TI AMx3 family of devices use a similar EMIF to other TI SoCs but have
different PM requirements. Late suspend code runs from SRAM and requires
save and restore of EMIF context and placing the SDRAM in and out of
self-refresh. Because of this, the ti-emif-sram driver introduces
relocatable PM function that can run from SRAM and place the EMIF in
the proper state for low-power mode transition.

EMIF Device Node:
====================
A emif node is used to represent an EMIF IP instance within an SoC. The node
must contain a phandle to an sram node so the ti-emif-sram driver can allocate
space within the sram and copy the relocatable PM functions.

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible:		Should be "ti,am3352-emif" for AM33xx SoCs
- reg:			Contains the emif register address ranges.
- sram:			Phandle for generic sram node for the driver
			to use to copy PM functions to.

Example:
--------
/* AM33xx */
emif: emif@4c000000 {
	compatible = "ti,am3352-emif";
	reg =	<0x4C000000 0x1000>;
	sram = <&ocmcram>;
};

Support for VTT Toggle

In order to enable the support for VTT toggle during Suspend/Resume sequence
needed by some boards (like EVM-SK), below DT properties needs to be added
under the M3 Wakeup Node

Required properties:
- ti,needs_vtt_toggle:	Indicates that the boards requires VTT toggling
			during suspend/resume.
- vtt-gpio-pin:	Specifies the GPIO pin used for VTT toggle.

Important Note:
- Here it is assumed that VTT Toggle will be done using a pin on GPIO-0 Instance

Example:
	wkup_m3: wkup_m3@44d00000 {
		ti,needs_vtt_toggle;
		vtt-gpio-pin = <7>;
	};

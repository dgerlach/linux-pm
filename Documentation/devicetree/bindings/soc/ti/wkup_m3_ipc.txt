Wakeup M3 IPC Driver
=====================

TI AMx3 family of devices use a Cortex M3 co-processor to help with various
low power tasks that cannot be controlled from the MPU like suspend/resume
and certain deep C-states for CPU Idle. Once the wkup_m3_ipc driver uses the
wkup_m3_rproc driver to boot the wkup_m3, it handles communication with the
CM3 using IPC registers present in the SoC's control module and a mailbox.
The wkup_m3_ipc exposes an API to allow the SoC PM code to execute specific
PM tasks.

Wkup M3 Device Node:
====================
A wkup_m3_ipc device node is used to represent a wakeup M3 IP instance within
an SoC. The sub-mailboxes are represented as child node of this parent node.

Required properties:
--------------------
- compatible:		Should be "ti,am3353-wkup-m3-ipc" for AM33xx SoCs
- reg:			Contains the wkup_m3 register address ranges for
			ipc-regs.
- reg-names:		Name for ipc-regs given above
- interrupts:		Contains the interrupt information for the wkup_m3
			interrupt that signals the MPU.
- ti,rproc:		Phandle to the wkup_m3 rproc node so the IPC driver
			can boot it.
- mboxes:		Phandles used by IPC framework to get correct mbox
			channel for communication. Must point to appropriate
			mbox_wkupm3 child node.

Example:
--------
/* AM33xx */
wkup_m3_ipc: wkup_m3_ipc@44e11324 {
	compatible = "ti,am3353-wkup-m3-ipc";
	reg = <0x44e11324 0x0024>;
	reg-names = "ipc_regs";
	interrupts = <78>;
	ti,rproc = <&wkup_m3>;
	mboxes = <&mailbox &mbox_wkupm3>;
};
